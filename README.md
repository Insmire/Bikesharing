## Overview
The purpose of this project is to utilize Tableau to create visualizations based on 2019 August New York City Citi Bike rider data. The Tableau story includes but is not limited to
* the duration of time all riders and each gender checks out a bike,
* the number of bikes used each hour in each day of the week, and 
* the amount of bikes used each hour per day of the week differentiated by gender and user type.

## Summary

Aside from the dataset given, one analysis we can do is to compare current trends with data of another month or even analyze data of a given year. Citi Bike may be interested in bike usage in different seasons of the year so that they can take more bikes into maintenance during the time of less bike usage.

Another analysis Citi Bike may be interested in is the amount or percentage of bikes that are located at a given starting location and a given ending location. By obtaining those numbers, Citi Bike will be able to determine how many bikes should be relocated to which station at the end of each day so that most or all riders will be able to check out a bike each day.
